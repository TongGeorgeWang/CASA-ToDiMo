Class averaging is a technique originally implemented for single-particle cryo electron microscopy image processing, where 2D images of a macromolecule in different orientations are aligned and separated into categories (classes) based on visual similarity. Images are subseqently averaged within the classes to reconstruct a high resolution model of the macromolecule, commonly to high spatial resolution. However, cryo-EM class averaging has usually been applied on proteins that are highly structured. This method utilizes spectral clustering, a large-dataset reduction technique rooted in graph theory, to class average macromolecules in 3D space. While it works with partially structured macromolecules, it thrives on disordered biopolymers with zero secondary or tertiary structure, which are represented with a structural ensemble rather than a single static state. <br />
